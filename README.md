# Missing Return Statement in Next.js 15 Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications: a missing `return` statement in a page component.  This leads to unexpected behavior and errors during runtime. The solution shows how to properly include a return statement to render the expected content.

## Bug
The `pages/about.js` file is missing a `return` statement within the functional component.  Next.js expects a component to return JSX to render.  The absence of a return statement will lead to a runtime error.

## Solution
The `pages/aboutSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to structure the page component, including the necessary `return` statement that renders JSX.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about` to see the error
5. Replace `/pages/about.js` with `/pages/aboutSolution.js` and rerun the development server. The error will be resolved.
